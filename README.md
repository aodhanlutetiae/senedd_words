# senedd_words

This app allows you to seach everything that's been said in the Welsh parliament (the Senedd) since the election of May 2016. It uses the [files](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pwdata/scrapedxml/senedd/en/) assembled by [They Work For You](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/) from the Senedd's [open data](https://senedd.wales/help/open-data/).

It was made by [@aodhanlutetiae](https://x.com/aodhanlutetiae) and takes the [the Westminster version](https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/) of [@puntofisso](https://puntofisso.net/) as inspiration.

Looking up a word will show how frequently it was used in the parliament as a proportion of all the words uttered that year. So looking up 'Brexit' shows it was used much more often in 2019, as a proportion of everything said that year.
