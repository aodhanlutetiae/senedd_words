# senedd_words

This app allows you to seach everything that's been said in the Welsh parliament, the Senedd, since the election of May 2016. It uses the  [clean organised files](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pwdata/scrapedxml/senedd/en/) that [They Work For You](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/) produce from what the Senedd publishes.

Looking up a word will show how frequently it was used in the parliament each year as a proportion of all the words uttered. So looking up the word 'Brexit' shows it appeared much more often in 2019.
